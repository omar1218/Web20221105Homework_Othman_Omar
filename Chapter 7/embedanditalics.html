        <p>hey look, this is a paragraph I'm typing- OK I'm back to my old keyboard because this is stupid, had to buy a dactyl manuform keyboard, 
            wouldn't recommend it if you have like finals, projects, you know, stuff you should be more concerned about than learning to type on this stupid thing
